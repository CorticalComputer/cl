Welcome to the Erlang OpenCL binding

To get started you need erlang, preferably R13. You also need
GCC and a machine with OpenCL installed. Currently only Mac Os X 10.6.x
is known to work. Then linux support is on it's way.

To build: just run make

To build examples: Goto the examples directory and run make.

Make sure erlang finds the cl/ebin directory.
