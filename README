Welcome to the Erlang OpenCL binding

To get started you need erlang, preferably R14. You also need
GCC and a machine with OpenCL installed. 

To build: just run make

To build examples: Goto the examples directory and run make.

Make sure erlang finds the cl/ebin directory.

Windows Users: 
I'm assuming you got an mingw environment, otherwise you are on your own.

mkdir -p /opt/local/include/CL
mkdir -p /opt/local/lib

Download all headers from http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/
and put them in /opt/local/include/CL

Find a OpenCL.lib available in Nvidia or ATI developments kits
cp /c/CUDA/lib/OpenCL.dll /opt/local/lib

Also you might need autoconf package available at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files_beta/MSYS/

OpenCL with ATI drivers for CPU usage don't work when erlang
is started within a mingw shell but does if you start it from
a Windows CMD.exe shell.
